## Article-Level Metrics

Traditionally, the impact of research articles has been measured by the publication journal. But a more informative view is one that examines the overall performance and reach of the articles themselves. Article-Level Metrics (ALM) capture the manifold ways in which research is disseminated and used.

## Lagotto

Lagotto is an Open Source application started in March 2009 by the Open Access publisher [Public Library of Science (PLOS)](http://www.plos.org/). Lagotto retrieves data from a wide set of services ([sources](/docs/sources)). Some of these sources represent the actual channels where users are directly viewing, sharing, discussing, citing, recommending the articles (e.g., Twitter and Mendeley). Others are third-party vendors which provide this information (e.g., CrossRef for citations).
