### [ALM 3.4.8](https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm/releases/tag/v.3.4.8)

ALM 3.4.8 was released on August 28, 2014 with the following bugfix:

* don't send email alerts for delayed_job errors

### [ALM 3.4.2](https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm/releases/tag/v.3.4.2)

ALM 3.4.2 was released on August 24, 2014 with the following bugfix:

* fixed issue with caching of the admin panel

## [ALM 3.4](https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm/releases/tag/v.3.4)

ALM 3.4 was released on August 22, 2014 with the following new features:

* better caching of the admin panel
* simplified admin panel navigation, and more information made available to regular users
* publisher model with support for automated article import via CrossRef API
* more granular error reporting with levels `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`and `FATAL`
* Alerts API for admin users
* new `/heartbeat` API endpoint to check application health
* many bug fixes

To enable the automated daily article import via CrossRef API, add the following line to `config/settings.yml`:

```yaml
import: member
```

To import articles manually, leave import empty; or use one of the following options for automated daily import via cron:

* `import: all`: All DOIs updated the last day
* `import: sample`: A random sample of 20 from all DOIs updated the last day
* `import: member`: All DOIs from the publishers in the publisher admin interface, updated the last day
* `import: member_sample`: A random sample of 20 from all DOIs from the publishers in the publisher admin interface, updated the last day

Publishers can now be added in the admin interface. The only functionality is currently the automated article import described above.

For admin users alerts are now available via API, use the `/api/v4/alerts` endpoint and basic authentication. More details in the API documentation.

There is one configuration change in error reporting: the `disabled_source_report` has been renamed to `fatal_error_report`, as an immediate email will now be sent for all errors with severity `FATAL`. To rename the report template in the database, run this rake task once (using the appropriate `RAILS_ENV`):

```
bundle exec rake mailer:rename_report RAILS_ENV=production
```

## [ALM 2.8](https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm/releases/tag/v.2.8)

ALM 2.8 was released on July 22, 2013. The development work focused on user account management.

#### User accounts

Prior to this release, the ALM application allowed only a single user account. We can now have multiple user accounts, plus different roles for them:

* API user - to obtain an API key
* staff - read-only access to the admin dashboard
* admin - full access to the admin dashboard

A new user admin dashboard facilitates user management.

#### Social login

To facilitate account management for users and ALM admins, new user accounts can only be created via social login with one of these services:

* [Github OAuth](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/)
* [Mozilla Persona](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/)

The ALM application can be configured to use one of these services (but not both), or to use the old system of only a single admin user. The documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.

#### API keys

Now that API keys are created within the ALM application, we can check for valid API keys in every API request. This is currently only done to allow access to private sources for admins, and to enable create/update/delete in the REST API. For security reasons create/update/delete only works from requests originating from the same computer.

#### Documentation

The documentation in the wiki is now included in the application, making it easier for users to find documentation. We use the [github-markdown gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/github-markdown) for this. The documentation has been updated with the changes in ALM 2.8, and other updates.

#### Other Changes

Many small changes and bug fixes. We now use memcached for caching, and we added to cron jobs to clean up temporary tables (error_messages and api_requests).

## [ALM 2.7](https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm/releases/tag/v.2.7)

ALM 2.7 was released on May 16, 2013. The development work focused on adding Javascript libraries that talk to the ALM API and can be embedded in other web sites.

#### Javascript single article visualizations

We added visualizations for single articles using the d3.js library, including time-based visualizations by day, month and year. We have created a new [Github repository](https://github.com/articlemetrics/almviz) that will hold all future work on Javascript libraries talking to the ALM API. To make these visualizations easier we made two changes to the [v3 ALM API](API):

* added signposts (views, shares, bookmarks, citations) as summary information
* added metrics by day, month and year for every source

#### Other Changes

We have made it easier to install the ALM application by adding and testing support for Amazon AWS via Vagrant. We added rake tasks to seed or delete articles, and to delete resolved errors and old API requests. Many small bugs were fixed and the ALM application was updated to use the latest Rails version (3.2.13).

## [ALM 2.6](https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm/releases/tag/v.2.6)

ALM 2.6 was released on March 19, 2013. The development work focused on two areas: API performance and easy installation.

#### API Performance

The API code was refactored, adding the [Draper Decorator](https://github.com/drapergem/draper) between the model and the [RABL Views](https://github.com/nesquena/rabl). We added caching, using Russian Doll fragment caching as described [here](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3113-how-key-based-cache-expiration-works). It required some extra work to make this work with RABL and Draper. We also added a visualization of API requests to the admin dashboard, using d3.js and the [crossfiler](http://square.github.com/crossfilter/) library.

#### Easy Installation

To make it easier to install the ALM application, we have updated and throughoutly tested the [manual installation](installation) instructions, updated the Chef / Vagrant automated installation (now using Ubuntu 12.04 and linking directly to the Chef Cookbook repository), and provided a VMware image of ALM application (535 MB [download](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9406373/alm_ubuntu_12.04_vmware.tar.gz), username/password: alm). The VMware image file is still experimental and feedback is appreciated.

An updated version of [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html) (1.1) was released days after ALM 2.6, and this version now supports VMware and AWS. We will support these platforms in a future ALM release to again make it easier to test or install the ALM application.

#### Other Changes

This release includes many small fixes and improvements. Of particular interest are the RSS feeds for the most popular articles by source, published in the last 7 days, 30 days, 12 months, or all-time. The RSS feeds are link from the most-cited lists for each source, e.g. [here](http://alm.plos.org/sources/twitter).
